#### Requirements

To qualify to become a horizon walker, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.

##### Skills

  [Knowledge](/srd/skills/knowledge.htm) (geography) 8 ranks.

##### Feats

  [Endurance](/srd/feats.htm#endurance).

#### Class Features

All of the following are features of the horizon walker prestige class.

##### Weapon and Armor Proficiency

Horizon walkers gain no [proficiency](/srd/combat/combatModifiers.htm#weaponArmorAndShieldProficiency) with any weapon or armor.

##### Terrain Mastery

At each level, the Horizon Walker adds a new terrain environment to their repertoire from those given below. Terrain mastery gives a horizon walker a bonus on checks involving a skill useful in that terrain, or some other appropriate benefit. A horizon walker also knows how to fight dangerous creatures typically found in that terrain, gaining a +1 [insight bonus](/srd/theBasics.htm#insightBonus) on [attack rolls](/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#attackRoll) and damage rolls against creatures with that terrain mentioned in the Environment entry of their descriptions. The horizon walker only gains the bonus if the creature description specifically lists the terrain type.

Horizon walkers take their terrain mastery with them wherever they go. They retain their terrain mastery bonuses on [skill checks](/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#skillChecks), [attack rolls](/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#attackRoll), and damage rolls whether they’re actually in the relevant terrain or not.

##### Planar Terrain Mastery

Planar terrain mastery functions just like terrain mastery, except that the horizon walker can choose one of the planar categories at each level. The horizon walker can take a non-planar terrain type instead, if she wishes.
