#### Requirements

To qualify to become a loremaster, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.

##### Skills

  [Knowledge](/srd/skills/knowledge.htm) (any two) 10 ranks in each.

##### Feats

Any three metamagic or item creation feats, plus [Skill Focus](/srd/feats.htm#skillFocus) ( [Knowledge](/srd/skills/knowledge.htm) [any individual Knowledge skill]).

##### Spells

Able to cast seven different divination spells, one of which must be 3rd level or higher.

#### Class Features

All of the following are Class Features of the loremaster prestige class.

##### Weapon and Armor Proficiency

Loremasters gain no [proficiency](/srd/combat/combatModifiers.htm#weaponArmorAndShieldProficiency) with any weapon or armor.

##### Spells per Day/Spells Known

When a new loremaster level is gained, the character gains new spells per day (and spells known, if applicable) as if she had also gained a level in a spellcasting class she belonged to before she added the prestige class. She does not, however, gain any other benefit a character of that class would have gained. This essentially means that she adds the level of loremaster to the level of some other spellcasting class the character has, then determines spells per day, spells known, and caster level accordingly.

##### Secret

At 1st level and every two levels higher than 1st (3rd, 5th, 7th, and 9th), the loremaster chooses one secret from the table below. Her loremaster level plus Intelligence modifier determines the secrets from which she can choose. She canâ€™t choose the same secret twice.

##### Lore

At 2nd level, a loremaster gains the ability to know legends or information regarding various topics, just as a [bard](/srd/classes/bard.htm) can with bardic knowledge. The loremaster adds her level and her Intelligence modifier to the lore check, which functions otherwise exactly like a bardic knowledge check.

##### Bonus Languages

A loremaster can choose any new language at 4th and 8th level.

##### Greater Lore ( [Ex](/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities))

At 6th level, a loremaster gains the ability to understand magic items, as with the [identify](/srd/spells/identify.htm) spell.

##### True Lore ( [Ex](/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities))

At 10th level, once per day a loremaster can use her knowledge to gain the effect of a [legend lore](/srd/spells/legendLore.htm) spell or an [analyze dweomer](/srd/spells/analyzeDweomer.htm) spell.
