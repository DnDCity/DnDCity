# Sorcerers & Wizards

A wizard or sorcerer can obtain a familiar. Doing so takes 24 hours and uses up magical materials that cost 100 gp. A familiar is a [magical beast](/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#magicalBeastType) that resembles a small animal and is unusually tough and intelligent. The creature serves as a companion and servant.

The wizard or sorcerer chooses the kind of familiar he gets. As the wizard or sorcerer advances in level, his familiar also increases in power.

If the familiar dies or is dismissed by the wizard or sorcerer, the wizard or sorcerer must attempt a DC 15 [Fortitude saving throw](/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#fortitude). Failure means he loses 200 experience points per wizard or sorcerer level; success reduces the loss to one-half that amount. However, a wizard or sorcerer’s experience point total can never go below 0 as the result of a familiar’s demise or dismissal. A slain or dismissed familiar cannot be replaced for a year and day. A slain familiar can be raised from the dead just as a character can be, and it does not lose a level or a Constitution point when this happy event occurs.

A character with more than one class that grants a familiar may have only one familiar at a time.

A familiar is a normal [animal](/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#animalType) that gains new powers and becomes a [magical beast](/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#magicalBeastType) when summoned to service by a sorcerer or wizard. It retains the appearance, Hit Dice, base attack bonus, base save bonuses, skills, and feats of the normal animal it once was, but it is treated as a [magical beast](/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#magicalBeastType) instead of an [animal](/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#animalType) for the purpose of any effect that depends on its type. Only a normal, unmodified animal may become a familiar. An animal companion cannot also function as a familiar.

A familiar also grants special abilities to its master (a sorcerer or wizard), as given on the table below. These special abilities apply only when the master and familiar are within 1 mile of each other.

Levels of different classes that are entitled to familiars stack for the purpose of determining any familiar abilities that depend on the master’s level.

##### Familiar Basics

Use the basic statistics for a creature of the familiar’s kind, but make the following changes:

###### Hit Dice

For the purpose of effects related to number of Hit Dice, use the master’s character level or the familiar’s normal HD total, whichever is higher.

###### Hit Points

The familiar has one-half the master’s total hit points (not including temporary hit points), rounded down, regardless of its actual Hit Dice.

###### Attacks

Use the master’s base attack bonus, as calculated from all his classes. Use the familiar’s Dexterity or Strength modifier, whichever is greater, to get the familiar’s melee attack bonus with [natural weapons](/srd/specialAbilities.htm#naturalWeapons).

Damage equals that of a normal creature of the familiar’s kind.

###### Saving Throws

For each [saving throw](/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#savingThrows), use either the familiar’s base save bonus (Fortitude +2, Reflex +2, Will +0) or the master’s (as calculated from all his classes), whichever is better. The familiar uses its own ability modifiers to saves, and it doesn’t share any of the other bonuses that the master might have on saves.

###### Skills

For each skill in which either the master or the familiar has ranks, use either the normal [skill ranks](/srd/skills/skillsSummary.htm#skillRanks) for an animal of that type or the master’s skill ranks, whichever are better. In either case, the familiar uses its own ability modifiers. Regardless of a familiar’s total skill modifiers, some skills may remain beyond the familiar’s ability to use.

| Master Class Level | Natural Armor Adj. | Int | Special |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st-2nd | +1 | 6 | Alertness, improved evasion,  
share spells, empathic link |
| 3rd-4th | +2 | 7 | Deliver touch spells |
| 5th-6th | +3 | 8 | Speak with master |
| 7th-8th | +4 | 9 | Speak with animals of its kind |
| 9th-10th | +5 | 10 | |
| 11th-12th | +6 | 11 | Spell resistance |
| 13th-14th | +7 | 12 | Scry on familiar |
| 15th-16th | +8 | 13 | |
| 17th-18th | +9 | 14 | |
| 19th-20th | +10 | 15 | |

##### Familiar Ability Descriptions

All familiars have special abilities (or impart abilities to their masters) depending on the master’s combined level in classes that grant familiars, as shown on the table below. The abilities given on the table are cumulative.

###### Natural Armor Adj.

The number noted here is an improvement to the familiar’s existing [natural armor bonus](/srd/theBasics.htm#naturalArmorBonus).

###### Int

The familiar’s Intelligence score.

###### Alertness ( [Ex](/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities))

While a familiar is within arm’s reach, the master gains the [Alertness](/srd/feats.htm#alertness) feat.

###### Improved Evasion ( [Ex](/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities))

When subjected to an attack that normally allows a [Reflex saving throw](/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#reflex) for half damage, a familiar takes no damage if it makes a successful saving throw and half damage even if the saving throw fails.

###### Share Spells

At the master’s option, he may have any spell (but not any [spell-like ability](/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellLikeAbilities)) he casts on himself also affect his familiar. The familiar must be within 5 feet at the time of casting to receive the benefit.

If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the familiar if it moves farther than 5 feet away and will not affect the familiar again even if it returns to the master before the duration expires. Additionally, the master may cast a spell with a target of "You" on his familiar (as a touch range spell) instead of on himself.

A master and his familiar can share spells even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of the familiar’s type ( [magical beast](/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#magicalBeastType)).

###### Empathic Link ( [Su](/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities))

The master has an empathic link with his familiar out to a distance of up to 1 mile. The master cannot see through the familiar’s eyes, but they can communicate empathically. Because of the limited nature of the link, only general emotional content can be communicated.

Because of this empathic link, the master has the same connection to an item or place that his familiar does.

###### Deliver Touch Spells ( [Su](/srd/specialAbilities.htm#supernaturalAbilities))

If the master is 3rd level or higher, a familiar can deliver touch spells for him. If the master and the familiar are in contact at the time the master casts a touch spell, he can designate his familiar as the "toucher." The familiar can then deliver the touch spell just as the master could. As usual, if the master casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the touch spell dissipates.

###### Speak with Master ( [Ex](/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities))

If the master is 5th level or higher, a familiar and the master can communicate verbally as if they were using a common language. Other creatures do not understand the communication without magical help.

###### Speak with Animals of Its Kind ( [Ex](/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities))

If the master is 7th level or higher, a familiar can communicate with animals of approximately the same kind as itself (including dire varieties): bats with bats, rats with rodents, cats with felines, hawks and owls and ravens with birds, lizards and snakes with reptiles, toads with amphibians, weasels with similar creatures (weasels, minks, polecats, ermines, skunks, wolverines, and badgers). Such communication is limited by the intelligence of the conversing creatures.

###### Spell Resistance ( [Ex](/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities))

If the master is 11th level or higher, a familiar gains [spell resistance](/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellResistance) equal to the master’s level + 5. To affect the familiar with a spell, another spellcaster must get a result on a [caster level check](/srd/magicOverview/castingSpells.htm#casterLevelChecks) (1d20 + caster level) that equals or exceeds the familiar’s spell resistance.

###### Scry on Familiar ( [Sp](/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellLikeAbilities))

If the master is 13th level or higher, he may scry on his familiar (as if casting the [scrying](/srd/spells/scrying.htm) spell) once per day.

## Arcane Spells And Armor

Wizards and sorcerers do not know how to wear armor effectively.

If desired, they can wear armor anyway (though they’ll be clumsy in it), or they can gain training in the proper use of armor (with the various Armor Proficiency feats— [light](/srd/feats.htm#armorProficiencyLight), [medium](/srd/feats.htm#armorProficiencyMedium), and [heavy](/srd/feats.htm#armorProficiencyHeavy)—and the [Shield Proficiency](/srd/feats.htm#shieldProficiency) feat), or they can multiclass to add a class that grants them armor proficiency. Even if a wizard or sorcerer is wearing armor with which he or she is proficient, however, it might still interfere with spellcasting.

Armor restricts the complicated gestures that a wizards or sorcerer must make while casting any spell that has a somatic component (most do). The armor and shield descriptions list the arcane spell failure chance for different armors and shields.

By contrast, [bards](/srd/classes/bard.htm) not only know how to wear light armor effectively, but they can also ignore the arcane spell failure chance for such armor. A bard wearing armor heavier than light or using any type of shield incurs the normal arcane spell failure chance, even if he becomes [proficient](/srd/combat/combatModifiers.htm#weaponArmorAndShieldProficiency) with that armor.

If a spell doesn’t have a somatic component, an arcane spellcaster can cast it with no problem while wearing armor. Such spells can also be cast even if the caster’s hands are bound or if he or she is [grappling](/srd/conditionSummary.htm#grappling) (although [Concentration](/srd/skills/concentration.htm) checks still apply normally). Also, the metamagic feat [Still Spell](/srd/feats.htm#stillSpell) allows a spellcaster to prepare or cast a spell at one spell level higher than normal without the somatic component. This also provides a way to cast a spell while wearing armor without risking arcane spell failure.
