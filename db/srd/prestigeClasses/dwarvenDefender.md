# Dwarven Defender

##### Hit Die

d12.

#### Requirements

To qualify to become a defender, a character must fulfill all the following criteria.

##### Race

Dwarf.

##### Alignment

Any lawful.

##### Base Attack Bonus

+7.

##### Feats

  [Dodge](/srd/feats.htm#dodge), [Endurance](/srd/feats.htm#endurance), [Toughness](/srd/feats.htm#toughness).

#### Class Skills

The defender’s class skills (and the key ability for each skill) are [Craft](/srd/skills/craft.htm) (Int), [Listen](/srd/skills/listen.htm) (Wis), [Sense Motive](/srd/skills/senseMotive.htm) (Wis), and [Spot](/srd/skills/spot.htm) (Wis).

##### Skill Points at Each Level

2 + Int modifier.

#### Class Features

All of the following are Class Features of the dwarven defender prestige class.

##### AC Bonus ( [Ex](/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities))

The dwarven defender receives a [dodge bonus](/srd/theBasics.htm#dodgeBonus) to Armor Class that starts at +1 and improves as the defender gains levels, until it reaches +4 at 10th level.

##### Weapon and Armor Proficiency

A dwarven defender is [proficient](/srd/combat/combatModifiers.htm#weaponArmorAndShieldProficiency) with all [simple and martial weapons](/srd/equipment/weapons.htm#simpleMartialandExoticWeapons), all types of armor, and shields.

##### Defensive Stance

When he adopts a defensive stance, a defender gains phenomenal strength and durability, but he cannot move from the spot he is defending. He gains +2 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, a +2 [resistance bonus](/srd/theBasics.htm#resistanceBonus) on all saves, and a +4 [dodge bonus](/srd/theBasics.htm#dodgeBonus) to AC. The increase in Constitution increases the defender’s hit points by 2 points per level, but these hit points go away at the end of the defensive stance when the Constitution score drops back 4 points. These extra hit points are not lost first the way temporary hit points are. While in a defensive stance, a defender cannot use skills or abilities that would require him to shift his position. A defensive stance lasts for a number of rounds equal to 3 + the character’s (newly improved) Constitution modifier. A defender may end his defensive stance voluntarily prior to this limit. At the end of the defensive stance, the defender is winded and takes a -2 penalty to Strength for the duration of that encounter. A defender can only use his defensive stance a certain number of times per day as determined by his level (see Table: The Dwarven Defender). Using the defensive stance takes no time itself, but a defender can only do so during his action.

##### Uncanny Dodge ( [Ex](/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities))

Starting at 2nd level, a dwarven defender retains his Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) regardless of being caught [flat-footed](/srd/conditionSummary.htm#flatFooted) or struck by an [invisible](/srd/conditionSummary.htm#invisible) attacker. (He still loses any Dexterity bonus to AC if immobilized.)

If a character gains uncanny dodge from a second class, the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge (see below).

##### Trap Sense ( [Ex](/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities))

At 4th level, a dwarven defender gains a +1 bonus on [Reflex saves](/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#reflex) made to avoid traps and a +1 [dodge bonus](/srd/theBasics.htm#dodgeBonus) to AC against attacks by traps. At 8th level, these bonuses rise to +2. These bonuses stack with trap sense bonuses gained from other classes.

##### Damage Reduction ( [Ex](/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities))

At 6th level, a dwarven defender gains [damage reduction](/srd/specialAbilities.htm#damageReduction). Subtract 3 points from the damage the dwarven defender takes each time he is dealt damage. At 10th level, this damage reduction rises to 6/-. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.

##### Improved Uncanny Dodge ( [Ex](/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities))

At 6th level, a dwarven defender can no longer be [flanked](/srd/combat/combatModifiers.htm#flanking). This defense denies [rogues](/srd/classes/rogue.htm) the ability to use flank attacks to sneak attack the dwarven defender.

The exception to this defense is that a [rogue](/srd/classes/rogue.htm) at least four levels higher than the dwarven defender can [flank](/srd/combat/combatModifiers.htm#flanking) him (and thus sneak attack him).

If a character gains uncanny dodge (see above) from a second class the character automatically gains improved uncanny dodge, and the levels from those classes stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to [flank](/srd/combat/combatModifiers.htm#flanking) the character.

##### Mobile Defense ( [Ex](/srd/specialAbilities.htm#extraordinaryAbilities))

At 8th level, a dwarven defender can adjust his position while maintaining a defensive stance. While in a defensive stance, he can take one 5-foot step each round without losing the benefit of the stance.
