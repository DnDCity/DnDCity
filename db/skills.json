A [merchant’s scale](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/goodsAndServices.htm#scaleMerchants) gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Appraise checks involving any items that are valued by weight, including anything made of precious metals.\n\nThese bonuses stack.\n\nSee also: [epic usages](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/epic/skills.htm#appraise) of Appraise.\n\n##### Action\n\nAppraising an item takes 1 minute (ten consecutive [full-round actions](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#fullRoundActions)).\n\n##### Try Again\n\nNo. You cannot try again on the same object, regardless of success.\n\n##### Special\n\nA [dwarf](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/races.htm#dwarves) gets a +2 racial bonus on Appraise checks that are related to stone or metal items because dwarves are familiar with valuable items of all kinds (especially those made of stone or metal).\n\nThe master of a [raven](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/raven.htm) [familiar](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/sorcererWizard.htm#familiars) gains a +3 bonus on Appraise checks.\n\nA character with the [Diligent](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#diligent) feat gets a +2 bonus on Appraise checks.\n\n##### [Synergy](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#skillSynergy)\n\nIf you have 5 ranks in any [Craft](/skills/craft) skill, you gain a +2 bonus on Appraise checks related to items made with that [Craft](/skills/craft) skill.\n\n##### Untrained\n\nFor common items, failure on an untrained check means no estimate.

A successful check lets you move at half your speed along the surface for 1 round. A failure by 4 or less means you can’t move for 1 round. A failure by 5 or more means you fall. The difficulty varies with the surface, as follows:\n\n###### Being Attacked while Balancing\n\nYou are considered [flat-footed](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#flatFooted) while balancing, since you can’t move to avoid a blow, and thus you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). If you have 5 or more ranks in Balance, you aren’t considered [flat-footed](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#flatFooted) while balancing. If you take damage while balancing, you must make another Balance check against the same DC to remain standing.\n\n###### Accelerated Movement\n\nYou can try to walk across a precarious surface more quickly than normal. If you accept a -5 penalty, you can move your full speed as a [move action](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#moveActions). (Moving twice your speed in a round requires two Balance checks, one for each move action used.) You may also accept this penalty in order to [charge](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/specialAttacks.htm#charge) across a precarious surface; charging requires one Balance check for each multiple of your speed (or fraction thereof) that you charge.\n\nSee also: [epic usages](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/epic/skills.htm#balance) of Balance.\n\n##### Action\n\nNone. A Balance check doesn’t require an action; it is made as part of another action or as a reaction to a situation.\n\n##### Special\n\nIf you have the [Agile](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#agile) feat, you get a +2 bonus on Balance checks.\n\n##### [Synergy](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#skillSynergy)\n\nIf you have 5 or more ranks in [Tumble](/skills/tumble), you get a +2 bonus on Balance checks."},{"key":"bluff","url":"http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/bluff.htm","name":"Bluff","key_ability":"Cha","desc":"Bluff Examples | Example Circumstances | [Sense Motive](/skills/senseMotive)  \nModifier |\n| --- | --- |\n| The target wants to believe you. | -5 |\n| The bluff is believable and doesn’t affect the target much. | +0 |\n| The bluff is a little hard to believe or puts the target at some risk. | +5 |\n| The bluff is hard to believe or puts the target at significant risk. | +10 |\n| The bluff is way out there, almost too incredible to consider. | +20 |\n\n##### Check\n\nA Bluff check is opposed by the target’s [Sense Motive](/skills/senseMotive) check. See the accompanying table for examples of different kinds of bluffs and the modifier to the target’s [Sense Motive](/skills/senseMotive) check for each one.\n\nFavorable and unfavorable circumstances weigh heavily on the outcome of a bluff. Two circumstances can weigh against you: The bluff is hard to believe, or the action that the target is asked to take goes against its self-interest, nature, personality, orders, or the like. If it’s important, you can distinguish between a bluff that fails because the target doesn’t believe it and one that fails because it just asks too much of the target. For instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus on its [Sense Motive](/skills/senseMotive) check because the bluff demands something risky, and the [Sense Motive](/skills/senseMotive) check succeeds by 10 or less, then the target didn’t so much see through the bluff as prove reluctant to go along with it. A target that succeeds by 11 or more has seen through the bluff.\n\nA successful Bluff check indicates that the target reacts as you wish, at least for a short time (usually 1 round or less) or believes something that you want it to believe. Bluff, however, is not a [suggestion](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/suggestion.htm) spell.\n\nA bluff requires interaction between you and the target. Creatures unaware of you cannot be bluffed.\n\n###### Feinting in Combat\n\nYou can also use Bluff to mislead an opponent in melee combat (so that it can’t dodge your next attack effectively). To [feint](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/specialAttacks.htm#feint), make a Bluff check opposed by your target’s [Sense Motive](/skills/senseMotive) check, but in this case, the target may add its base attack bonus to the roll along with any other applicable modifiers.\n\nIf your Bluff check result exceeds this special [Sense Motive](/skills/senseMotive) check result, your target is denied its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for the next melee attack you make against it. This attack must be made on or before your next turn.\n\n  [Feinting](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/specialAttacks.htm#feint) in this way against a nonhumanoid is difficult because it’s harder to read a strange creature’s body language; you take a -4 penalty on your Bluff check. Against a creature of animal Intelligence (1 or 2) it’s even harder; you take a -8 penalty. Against a nonintelligent creature, it’s impossible.\n\n  [Feinting](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/specialAttacks.htm#feint) in combat does not provoke an [attack of opportunity](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/attacksOfOpportunity.htm).\n\n###### Creating a Diversion to Hide\n\nYou can use the Bluff skill to help you hide. A successful Bluff check gives you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a [Hide](/skills/hide) check while people are aware of you. This usage does not provoke an [attack of opportunity](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/attacksOfOpportunity.htm).\n\n###### Delivering a Secret Message\n\nYou can use Bluff to get a message across to another character without others understanding it. The DC is 15 for simple messages, or 20 for complex messages, especially those that rely on getting across new information. Failure by 4 or less means you can’t get the message across. Failure by 5 or more means that some false information has been implied or inferred. Anyone listening to the exchange can make a [Sense Motive](/skills/senseMotive) check opposed by the Bluff check you made to transmit in order to intercept your message (see [Sense Motive](/skills/senseMotive)).\n\nSee also: [epic usages](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/epic/skills.htm#bluff) of Bluff.\n\n##### Action\n\nVaries. A Bluff check made as part of general interaction always takes at least 1 round (and is at least a [full-round action](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#fullRoundActions)), but it can take much longer if you try something elaborate. A Bluff check made to [feint](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/specialAttacks.htm#feint) in combat or create a diversion to hide is a [standard action](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#standardActions). A Bluff check made to deliver a secret message doesn’t take an action; it is part of normal communication.\n\n##### Try Again\n\nVaries. Generally, a failed Bluff check in social interaction makes the target too suspicious for you to try again in the same circumstances, but you may retry freely on Bluff checks made to [feint](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/specialAttacks.htm#feint) in combat. Retries are also allowed when you are trying to send a message, but you may attempt such a retry only once per round.\n\nEach retry carries the same chance of miscommunication.\n\n##### Special\n\nA [ranger](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/ranger.htm) gains a bonus on Bluff checks when using this skill against a favored enemy.\n\nThe master of a [snake](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/snake.htm) [familiar](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/sorcererWizard.htm#familiars) gains a +3 bonus on Bluff checks.\n\nIf you have the [Persuasive](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#persuasive) feat, you get a +2 bonus on Bluff checks.\n\n##### [Synergy](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#skillSynergy)\n\nIf you have 5 or more ranks in Bluff, you get a +2 bonus on [Diplomacy](/skills/diplomacy), [Intimidate](/skills/intimidate), and [Sleight of Hand](/skills/sleightOfHand) checks, as well as on [Disguise](/skills/disguise) checks made when you know you’re being observed and you try to act in character."},{"key":"climb","url":"http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/climb.htm","name":"Climb","key_ability":"Str","armor_check_penalty":true,"desc":"##### Check\n\nWith a successful Climb check, you can advance up, down, or across a slope, a wall, or some other steep incline (or even a ceiling with handholds) at one-quarter your normal speed. A slope is considered to be any incline at an angle measuring less than 60 degrees; a wall is any incline at an angle measuring 60 degrees or more.\n\nA Climb check that fails by 4 or less means that you make no progress, and one that fails by 5 or more means that you fall from whatever height you have already attained.\n\nA [climber’s kit](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/goodsAndServices.htm#climbersKit) gives you a +2 [circumstance bonus](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/theBasics.htm#circumstanceModifier) on Climb checks.\n\nThe DC of the check depends on the conditions of the climb. Compare the task with those on the following table to determine an appropriate DC.\n\n| Climb  \nDC | Example Surface or Activity |\n| --- | --- |\n| 0 | A slope too steep to walk up, or a knotted rope with a wall to brace against. |\n| 5 | A rope with a wall to brace against, or a knotted rope, or a rope affected by the [rope trick](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/ropeTrick.htm) spell. |\n| 10 | A surface with ledges to hold on to and stand on, such as a very rough wall or a ship’s rigging. |\n| 15 | Any surface with adequate handholds and footholds (natural or artificial), such as a very rough natural rock surface or a tree, or an unknotted rope, or pulling yourself up when dangling by your hands. |\n| 20 | An uneven surface with some narrow handholds and footholds, such as a typical wall in a dungeon or ruins. |\n| 25 | A rough surface, such as a natural rock wall or a brick wall. |\n| 25 | An overhang or ceiling with handholds but no footholds. |\n| — | A perfectly smooth, flat, vertical surface cannot be climbed. |\n\n| Climb DC  \nModifier1 | Example Surface or Activity |\n| --- | --- |\n|  \n1. These modifiers are cumulative; use any that apply.\n\n|\n| -10 | Climbing a chimney (artificial or natural) or other location where you can brace against two opposite walls (reduces DC by 10). |\n| -5 | Climbing a corner where you can brace against perpendicular walls (reduces DC by 5). |\n| +5 | Surface is slippery (increases DC by 5). |\n\nYou need both hands free to climb, but you may cling to a wall with one hand while you cast a spell or take some other action that requires only one hand. While climbing, you can’t move to avoid a blow, so you lose your Dexterity bonus to AC (if any). You also can’t use a shield while climbing.\n\nAny time you take damage while climbing, make a Climb check against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means you fall from your current height and sustain the appropriate falling damage.\n\n###### Accelerated Climbing\n\nYou try to climb more quickly than normal. By accepting a -5 penalty, you can move half your speed (instead of one-quarter your speed).\n\n###### Making Your Own Handholds and Footholds\n\nYou can make your own handholds and footholds by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing so takes 1 minute per piton, and one piton is needed per 3 feet of distance. As with any surface that offers handholds and footholds, a wall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In the same way, a climber with a handaxe or similar implement can cut handholds in an ice wall.\n\n###### Catching Yourself When Falling\n\nIt’s practically impossible to catch yourself on a wall while falling. Make a Climb check (DC = wall’s DC + 20) to do so. It’s much easier to catch yourself on a slope (DC = slope’s DC + 10).\n\n###### Catching a Falling Character While Climbing\n\nIf someone climbing above you or adjacent to you falls, you can attempt to catch the falling character if he or she is within your reach. Doing so requires a successful melee [touch attack](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#touchAttacks) against the falling character (though he or she can voluntarily forego any Dexterity bonus to AC if desired). If you hit, you must immediately attempt a Climb check (DC = wall’s DC + 10). Success indicates that you catch the falling character, but his or her total weight, including equipment, cannot exceed your heavy load limit or you automatically fall. If you fail your Climb check by 4 or less, you fail to stop the character’s fall but don’t lose your grip on the wall. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail to stop the character’s fall and begin falling as well.\n\nSee also: [epic usages](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/epic/skills.htm#climb) of Climb.\n\n##### Action\n\nClimbing is part of movement, so it’s generally part of a [move action](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#moveActions) (and may be combined with other types of movement in a move action). Each move action that includes any climbing requires a separate Climb check. Catching yourself or another falling character doesn’t take an action.\n\n##### Special\n\nYou can use a rope to haul a character upward (or lower a character) through sheer strength. You can lift double your maximum load in this manner.\n\nA [halfling](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/races.htm#halflings) has a +2 racial bonus on Climb checks because halflings are agile and surefooted.\n\nThe master of a [lizard](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/lizard.htm) [familiar](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/sorcererWizard.htm#familiars) gains a +3 bonus on Climb checks.\n\nIf you have the [Athletic](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#athletic) feat, you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks.\n\nA creature with a climb speed has a +8 racial bonus on all Climb checks. The creature must make a Climb check to climb any wall or slope with a DC higher than 0, but it always can choose to [take 10](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#taking10), even if rushed or threatened while climbing. If a creature with a climb speed chooses an accelerated climb (see above), it moves at double its climb speed (or at its land speed, whichever is slower) and makes a single Climb check at a -5 penalty. Such a creature retains its Dexterity bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the [run](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#run) action while climbing.\n\n##### [Synergy](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#skillSynergy)\n\nIf you have 5 or more ranks in [Use Rope](/skills/useRope), you get a +2 bonus on Climb checks made to climb a rope, a knotted rope, or a rope-and-wall combination."},{"key":"concentration","url":"http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/concentration.htm","name":"Concentration","key_ability":"Con","desc":"##### Check\n\nYou must make a Concentration check whenever you might potentially be distracted (by taking damage, by harsh weather, and so on) while engaged in some action that requires your full attention. Such actions include casting a spell, concentrating on an active spell, directing a spell, using a [spell-like ability](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellLikeAbilities), or using a skill that would provoke an [attack of opportunity](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/attacksOfOpportunity.htm). In general, if an action wouldn’t normally provoke an attack of opportunity, you need not make a Concentration check to avoid being distracted.\n\nIf the Concentration check succeeds, you may continue with the action as normal. If the check fails, the action automatically fails and is wasted. If you were in the process of casting a spell, the spell is lost. If you were concentrating on an active spell, the spell ends as if you had ceased concentrating on it. If you were directing a spell, the direction fails but the spell remains active. If you were using a [spell-like ability](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellLikeAbilities), that use of the ability is lost. A skill use also fails, and in some cases a failed [skill check](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#skillChecks) may have other ramifications as well.\n\nThe table below summarizes various types of distractions that cause you to make a Concentration check. If the distraction occurs while you are trying to cast a spell, you must add the level of the spell you are trying to cast to the appropriate Concentration DC. If more than one type of distraction is present, make a check for each one; any failed Concentration check indicates that the task is not completed.\n\n| Concentration DC1 | Distraction |\n| --- | --- |\n|  \n1. If you are trying to cast, concentrate on, or direct a spell when the distraction occurs, add the level of the spell to the indicated DC.\n2. Such as during the casting of a spell with a casting time of 1 round or more, or the execution of an activity that takes more than a single [full-round action](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#fullRoundActions) (such as [Disable Device](/skills/disableDevice)). Also, damage stemming from an [attack of opportunity](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/attacksOfOpportunity.htm) or readied attack made in response to the spell being cast (for spells with a casting time of 1 [standard action](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#standardActions)) or the action being taken (for activities requiring no more than a full-round action).\n3.

If the spell allows no save, use the save DC it would have if it did allow a save.\n\n|\n| 10 + damage dealt | Damaged during the action.2 |\n| 10 + half of continuous damage last dealt | Taking continuous damage during the action.3 |\n| Distracting spell’s save DC | Distracted by nondamaging spell.4 |\n| 10 | Vigorous motion (on a moving mount, taking a bouncy wagon ride, in a small boat in rough water, belowdecks in a stormtossed ship). |\n| 15 | Violent motion (on a galloping horse, taking a very rough wagon ride, in a small boat in rapids, on the deck of a storm-tossed ship). |\n| 20 | Extraordinarily violent motion (earthquake). |\n| 15 | [Entangled](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#entangled). |\n| 20 | [Grappling](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#grappling) or [pinned](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#pinned). (You can cast only spells without somatic components for which you have any required material component in hand.) |\n| 5 | Weather is a high wind carrying blinding rain or sleet. |\n| 10 | Weather is wind-driven hail, dust, or debris. |\n| Distracting spell’s save DC | Weather caused by a spell, such as [storm of vengeance](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/stormOfVengeance.htm).4 |\n\n##### Action\n\nNone. Making a Concentration check doesn’t take an action; it is either a [free action](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#freeActions) (when attempted reactively) or part of another action (when attempted actively).\n\n##### Try Again\n\nYes, though a success doesn’t cancel the effect of a previous failure, such as the loss of a spell you were casting or the disruption of a spell you were concentrating on.\n\n##### Special\n\nYou can use Concentration to cast a spell, use a [spell-like ability](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellLikeAbilities), or use a skill defensively, so as to avoid [attacks of opportunity](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/attacksOfOpportunity.htm) altogether. This doesn’t apply to other actions that might provoke attacks of opportunity.\n\nThe DC of the check is 15 (plus the spell’s level, if casting a spell or using a [spell-like ability](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellLikeAbilities) defensively). If the Concentration check succeeds, you may attempt the action normally without provoking any [attacks of opportunity](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/attacksOfOpportunity.htm). A successful Concentration check still doesn’t allow you to [take 10](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#taking10) on another check if you are in a stressful situation; you must make the check normally. If the Concentration check fails, the related action also automatically fails (with any appropriate ramifications), and the action is wasted, just as if your concentration had been disrupted by a distraction.\n\nA character with the [Combat Casting](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#combatCasting) feat gets a +4 bonus on Concentration checks made to cast a spell or use a [spell-like ability](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#spellLikeAbilities) while on the defensive or while [grappling](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#grappling) or [pinned](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#pinned)."},{"key":"craft","url":"http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/craft.htm","name":"Craft","key_ability":"Int","desc":"Like [Knowledge](/skills/knowledge), [Perform](/skills/perform), and [Profession](/skills/profession), Craft is actually a number of separate skills. You could have several Craft skills, each with its own ranks, each purchased as a separate skill.\n\nA Craft skill is specifically focused on creating something. If nothing is created by the endeavor, it probably falls under the heading of a [Profession](/skills/profession) skill.\n\n##### Check\n\nYou can practice your trade and make a decent living, earning about half your check result in gold pieces per week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of your trade, how to perform the craft’s daily tasks, how to supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an average of 1 silver piece per day.)\n\nThe basic function of the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity of the item to be created. The DC, your check results, and the price of the item determine how long it takes to make a particular item. The item’s finished price also determines the cost of raw materials.\n\nIn some cases, the [fabricate](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/fabricate.htm) spell can be used to achieve the results of a Craft check with no actual check involved. However, you must make an appropriate Craft check when using the spell to make articles requiring a high degree of craftsmanship.\n\nA successful Craft check related to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the [ironwood](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/ironwood.htm) spell enables you to make wooden items that have the strength of steel.\n\nWhen casting the spell [minor creation](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/minorCreation.htm), you must succeed on an appropriate Craft check to make a complex item.\n\nAll crafts require [artisan’s tools](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/goodsAndServices.htm#artisansTools) to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is made with a -2 [circumstance penalty](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/theBasics.htm#circumstanceModifier). On the other hand, [masterwork artisan’s tools](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/goodsAndServices.htm#artisansToolsMasterwork) provide a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.\n\nTo determine how much time and money it takes to make an item, follow these steps.\n\n1. Find the item’s price. Put the price in silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).\n2. Find the DC from the table below.\n3. Pay one-third of the item’s price for the cost of raw materials.\n4. Make an appropriate Craft check representing one week’s work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by the DC. If the result × the DC equals the price of the item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the result × the DC equals double or triple the price of the item in silver pieces, then you’ve completed the task in one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result × the DC doesn’t equal the price, then it represents the progress you’ve made this week. Record the result and make a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make more progress until your total reaches the price of the item in silver pieces.\n\nIf you fail a check by 4 or less, you make no progress this week.\n\nIf you fail by 5 or more, you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the original raw material cost again.\n\n###### Progress by the Day\n\nYou can make checks by the day instead of by the week. In this case your progress (check result × DC) is in copper pieces instead of silver pieces.\n\n###### Creating Masterwork Items\n\nYou can make a masterwork item—a weapon, suit of armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use through its exceptional craftsmanship, not through being magical. To create a masterwork item, you create the masterwork component as if it were a separate item in addition to the standard item. The masterwork component has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a suit of armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both the standard component and the masterwork component are completed, the masterwork item is finished. Note: The cost you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.\n\n###### Repairing Items\n\nGenerally, you can repair an item by making checks against the same DC that it took to make the item in the first place. The cost of repairing an item is one-fifth of the item’s price.\n\nWhen you use the Craft skill to make a particular sort of item, the DC for checks involving the creation of that item are typically as given on the following table.\n\n| Item | Craft Skill | Craft DC |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n|  \n1.

This allows you to create the item more quickly (since you’ll be multiplying this higher DC by your Craft check result to determine progress). You must decide whether to increase the DC before you make each weekly or daily check.\n\nTo make an item using Craft (alchemy), you must have alchemical equipment and be a spellcaster. If you are working in a city, you can buy what you need as part of the raw materials cost to make the item, but alchemical equipment is difficult or impossible to come by in some places. Purchasing and maintaining an [alchemist’s lab](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/goodsAndServices.htm#alchemistsLab) grants a +2 [circumstance bonus](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/theBasics.htm#circumstanceModifier) on Craft (alchemy) checks because you have the perfect tools for the job, but it does not affect the cost of any items made using the skill.\n\n##### [Synergy](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#skillSynergy)\n\nIf you have 5 ranks in a Craft skill, you get a +2 bonus on [Appraise](/skills/appraise) checks related to items made with that Craft skill."},{"key":"decipherScript","url":"http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/decipherScript.htm","name":"Decipher Script","key_ability":"Int","trained_only":true,"desc":"##### Check\n\nYou can decipher writing in an unfamiliar language or a message written in an incomplete or archaic form.

Disabling (or rigging or jamming) a fairly simple device has a DC of 10; more intricate and complex devices have higher DCs.\n\nIf the check succeeds, you disable the device. If it fails by 4 or less, you have failed but can try again. If you fail by 5 or more, something goes wrong. If the device is a trap, you spring it. If you’re attempting some sort of sabotage, you think the device is disabled, but it still works normally.\n\nYou also can rig simple devices such as saddles or wagon wheels to work normally for a while and then fail or fall off some time later (usually after 1d4 rounds or minutes of use).\n\n| Device | Time | Disable  \nDevice DC1 | Example |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n|  \n1.

Disabling a simple device takes 1 round and is a [full-round action](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#fullRoundActions). An intricate or complex device requires 1d4 or 2d4 rounds.\n\n##### Try Again\n\nVaries.

A magic trap generally has a DC of 25 + the spell level of the magic used to create it.\n\nThe spells [fire trap](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/fireTrap.htm), [glyph of warding](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/glyphOfWarding.htm), [symbol](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/symbolOfDeath.htm), and [teleportation circle](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/teleportationCircle.htm) also create traps that a [rogue](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/rogue.htm) can disarm with a successful Disable Device check. [Spike growth](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/spikeGrowth.htm) and [spike stones](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/spikeStones.htm), however, create magic traps against which Disable Device checks do not succeed. See the individual spell descriptions for details.\n\n#### Other Ways To Beat A Trap\n\nIt’s possible to ruin many traps without making a Disable Device check.\n\n##### Ranged Attack Traps\n\nOnce a trap’s location is known, the obvious way to ruin it is to smash the mechanism—assuming the mechanism can be accessed. Failing that, it’s possible to plug up the holes from which the projectiles emerge. Doing this prevents the trap from firing unless its ammunition does enough damage to break through the plugs.\n\n##### Melee Attack Traps\n\nThese devices can be thwarted by smashing the mechanism or blocking the weapons, as noted above. Alternatively, if a character studies the trap as it triggers, he might be able to time his dodges just right to avoid damage. A character who is doing nothing but studying a trap when it first goes off gains a +4 [dodge bonus](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/theBasics.htm#dodgeBonus) against its attacks if it is triggered again within the next minute.\n\n##### Pits\n\nDisabling a pit trap generally ruins only the trapdoor, making it an uncovered pit. Filling in the pit or building a makeshift bridge across it is an application of manual labor, not the Disable Device skill. Characters could neutralize any spikes at the bottom of a pit by attacking them—they break just as daggers do.\n\n##### Magic Traps\n\n  [Dispel magic](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/dispelMagic.htm) helps here. Someone who succeeds on a [caster level check](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicOverview/castingSpells.htm#casterLevelChecks) against the level of the trap’s creator suppresses the trap for 1d4 rounds. This works only with a targeted [dispel magic](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/dispelMagic.htm), not the area version."},{"key":"disguise","url":"http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/disguise.htm","name":"Disguise","key_ability":"Cha","desc":"Disguise Check Modifiers | Disguise | Disguise Check  \nModifier |\n| --- | --- |\n|  \n1.

To forge a document on which the handwriting is not specific to a person (military orders, a government decree, a business ledger, or the like), you need only to have seen a similar document before, and you gain a +8 bonus on your check.

If the animal is wounded or has taken any [nonlethal damage](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/injuryandDeath.htm#nonlethalDamage) or [ability score damage](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#abilityDamage), the DC increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task or trick on its next action.\n\n###### Teach an Animal a Trick\n\nYou can teach an animal a specific trick with one week of work and a successful Handle Animal check against the indicated DC. An animal with an Intelligence score of 1 can learn a maximum of three tricks, while an animal with an Intelligence score of 2 can learn a maximum of six tricks. Possible tricks (and their associated DCs) include, but are not necessarily limited to, the following.\n\nAttack (DC 20): The animal attacks apparent enemies. You may point to a particular creature that you wish the animal to attack, and it will comply if able. Normally, an animal will attack only [humanoids](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#humanoidType), [monstrous humanoids](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#monstrousHumanoidType), [giants](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#giantType), or other [animals](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#animalType). Teaching an animal to attack all creatures (including such unnatural creatures as undead and [aberrations](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/typesSubtypes.htm#aberrationType)) counts as two tricks.\n\nCome (DC 15): The animal comes to you, even if it normally would not do so.\n\nDefend (DC 20): The animal defends you (or is ready to defend you if no threat is present), even without any command being given. Alternatively, you can command the animal to defend a specific other character.\n\nDown (DC 15): The animal breaks off from combat or otherwise backs down. An animal that doesn’t know this trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to injury, a [fear](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#fear) effect, or the like) or its opponent is defeated.\n\nFetch (DC 15): The animal goes and gets something. If you do not point out a specific item, the animal fetches some random object.\n\nGuard (DC 20): The animal stays in place and prevents others from approaching.\n\nHeel (DC 15): The animal follows you closely, even to places where it normally wouldn’t go.\n\nPerform (DC 15): The animal performs a variety of simple tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or barking, and so on.\n\nSeek (DC 15): The animal moves into an area and looks around for anything that is obviously alive or animate.\n\nStay (DC 15): The animal stays in place, waiting for you to return. It does not challenge other creatures that come by, though it still defends itself if it needs to.\n\nTrack (DC 20): The animal tracks the scent presented to it. (This requires the animal to have the [scent](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#scent) ability)\n\nWork (DC 15): The animal pulls or pushes a medium or heavy load.\n\n###### Train an Animal for a Purpose\n\nRather than teaching an animal individual tricks, you can simply train it for a general purpose. Essentially, an animal’s purpose represents a preselected set of known tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding or heavy labor. The animal must meet all the normal prerequisites for all tricks included in the training package. If the package includes more than three tricks, the animal must have an Intelligence score of 2.\n\nAn animal can be trained for only one general purpose, though if the creature is capable of learning additional tricks (above and beyond those included in its general purpose), it may do so. Training an animal for a purpose requires fewer checks than teaching individual tricks does, but no less time.\n\nCombat Riding (DC 20): An animal trained to bear a rider into combat knows the tricks attack, come, defend, down, guard, and heel. Training an animal for combat riding takes six weeks. You may also “upgrade” an animal trained for riding to one trained for combat riding by spending three weeks and making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check. The new general purpose and tricks completely replace the animal’s previous purpose and any tricks it once knew. Warhorses and [riding dogs](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/monsters/dogRiding.htm) are already trained to bear riders into combat, and they don’t require any additional training for this purpose.\n\nFighting (DC 20): An animal trained to engage in combat knows the tricks attack, down, and stay. Training an animal for fighting takes three weeks.\n\nGuarding (DC 20): An animal trained to guard knows the tricks attack, defend, down, and guard. Training an animal for guarding takes four weeks.\n\nHeavy Labor (DC 15): An animal trained for heavy labor knows the tricks come and work. Training an animal for heavy labor takes two weeks.\n\nHunting (DC 20): An animal trained for hunting knows the tricks attack, down, fetch, heel, seek, and track. Training an animal for hunting takes six weeks.\n\nPerformance (DC 15): An animal trained for performance knows the tricks come, fetch, heel, perform, and stay. Training an animal for performance takes five weeks.\n\nRiding (DC 15): An animal trained to bear a rider knows the tricks come, heel, and stay. Training an animal for riding takes three weeks.\n\n###### Rear a Wild Animal\n\nTo rear an animal means to raise a wild creature from infancy so that it becomes domesticated. A handler can rear as many as three creatures of the same kind at once.\n\nA successfully domesticated animal can be taught tricks at the same time it’s being raised, or it can be taught as a domesticated animal later.\n\nSee also: [epic usages](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/epic/skills.htm#handleAnimal) of Handle Animal.\n\n##### Action\n\nVaries. Handling an animal is a [move action](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#moveActions), while pushing an animal is a [full-round action](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#fullRoundActions). (A [druid](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/druid.htm) or [ranger](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/ranger.htm) can handle her animal companion as a [free action](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#freeActions) or push it as a move action.) For tasks with specific time frames noted above, you must spend half this time (at the rate of 3 hours per day per animal being handled) working toward completion of the task before you attempt the Handle Animal check. If the check fails, your attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal fails and you need not complete the teaching, rearing, or training time. If the check succeeds, you must invest the remainder of the time to complete the teaching, rearing, or training. If the time is interrupted or the task is not followed through to completion, the attempt to teach, rear, or train the animal automatically fails.\n\n##### Try Again\n\nYes, except for rearing an animal.\n\n##### Special\n\nYou can use this skill on a creature with an Intelligence score of 1 or 2 that is not an animal, but the DC of any such check increases by 5. Such creatures have the same limit on tricks known as animals do.\n\nA [druid](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/druid.htm) or [ranger](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/ranger.htm) gains a +4 [circumstance bonus](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/theBasics.htm#circumstanceModifier) on Handle Animal checks involving her animal companion.\n\nIn addition, a druid’s or ranger’s animal companion knows one or more bonus tricks, which don’t count against the normal limit on tricks known and don’t require any training time or Handle Animal checks to teach.\n\nIf you have the [Animal Affinity](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#animalAffinity) feat, you get a +2 bonus on Handle Animal checks.\n\n##### [Synergy](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#skillSynergy)\n\nIf you have 5 or more ranks in Handle Animal, you get a +2 bonus on [Ride](/skills/ride) checks and wild empathy checks.\n\n##### Untrained\n\nIf you have no ranks in Handle Animal, you can use a Charisma check to handle and push domestic animals, but you can’t teach, rear, or train animals. A [druid](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/druid.htm) or [ranger](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/ranger.htm) with no ranks in Handle Animal can use a Charisma check to handle and push her animal companion, but she can’t teach, rear, or train other nondomestic animals."},{"key":"heal","url":"http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/heal.htm","name":"Heal","key_ability":"Wis","desc":"Heal DCs | Task | Heal DC |\n| --- | --- |\n| First aid | 15 |\n| Long-term care | 15 |\n| Treat wound from [caltrop](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/goodsAndServices.htm#caltrops),  \n[spike growth](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/spikeGrowth.htm), or [spike stones](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/spikeStones.htm) | 15 |\n| Treat poison | Poison’s  \nsave DC |\n| Treat disease | Disease’s  \nsave DC |\n\n##### Check\n\nThe DC and effect depend on the task you attempt.\n\n###### First Aid\n\nYou usually use first aid to save a [dying](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#dying) character. If a character has negative hit points and is losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour, or 1 per day), you can make him or her [stable](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#stable). A stable character regains no hit points but stops losing them.\n\n###### Long-Term Care\n\nProviding long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day or more. If your Heal check is successful, the patient recovers hit points or ability score points (lost to [ability damage](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#abilityDamage)) at twice the normal rate: 2 hit points per level for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 hit points per level for each full day of complete rest; 2 ability score points for a full 8 hours of rest in a day, or 4 ability score points for each full day of complete rest.\n\nYou can tend as many as six patients at a time. You need a few items and supplies (bandages, salves, and so on) that are easy to come by in settled lands. Giving long-term care counts as light activity for the healer. You cannot give long-term care to yourself.\n\n###### Treat Wound from Caltrop, [Spike Growth](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/spikeGrowth.htm), or [Spike Stones](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/spikeStones.htm)\n\nA creature wounded by stepping on a [caltrop](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/goodsAndServices.htm#caltrops) moves at one-half normal speed. A successful Heal check removes this movement penalty.\n\nA creature wounded by a [spike growth](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/spikeGrowth.htm) or [spike stones](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/spikeStones.htm) spell must succeed on a [Reflex save](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#reflex) or take injuries that reduce his speed by one-third. Another character can remove this penalty by [taking 10](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#taking10) minutes to dress the victim’s injuries and succeeding on a Heal check against the spell’s save DC.\n\n###### Treat Poison\n\nTo treat [poison](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#poison) means to tend a single character who has been poisoned and who is going to take more damage from the [poison](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#poison) (or suffer some other effect). Every time the poisoned character makes a [saving throw](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#savingThrows) against the poison, you make a Heal check. The poisoned character uses your check result or his or her saving throw, whichever is higher.\n\n###### Treat Disease\n\nTo treat a [disease](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#disease) means to tend a single diseased character. Every time he or she makes a [saving throw](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#savingThrows) against disease effects, you make a Heal check. The diseased character uses your check result or his or her saving throw, whichever is higher.\n\nSee also: [epic usages](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/epic/skills.htm#heal) of Heal.\n\n##### Action\n\nProviding first aid, treating a wound, or treating [poison](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#poison) is a [standard action](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#standardActions). Treating a disease or tending a creature wounded by a [spike growth](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/spikeGrowth.htm) or [spike stones](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/spikeStones.htm) spell takes 10 minutes of work. Providing long-term care requires 8 hours of light activity.\n\n##### Try Again\n\nVaries. Generally speaking, you can’t try a Heal check again without proof of the original check’s failure. You can always retry a check to provide first aid, assuming the target of the previous attempt is still alive.\n\n##### Special\n\nA character with the [Self-Sufficient](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#selfSufficient) feat gets a +2 bonus on Heal checks.\n\nA [healer’s kit](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/equipment/goodsAndServices.htm#healersKit) gives you a +2 [circumstance bonus](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/theBasics.htm#circumstanceModifier) on Heal checks."},{"key":"hide","url":"http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/hide.htm","name":"Hide","key_ability":"Dex","armor_check_penalty":true,"desc":"##### Check\n\nYour Hide check is opposed by the [Spot](/skills/spot) check of anyone who might see you. You can move up to one-half your normal speed and hide at no penalty. When moving at a speed greater than one-half but less than your normal speed, you take a -5 penalty. It’s practically impossible (-20 penalty) to hide while attacking, running or charging.\n\nA creature larger or smaller than Medium takes a size bonus or penalty on Hide checks depending on its size category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8, Small +4, Large -4, Huge -8, Gargantuan -12, Colossal -16.\n\nYou need [cover](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatModifiers.htm#cover) or [concealment](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatModifiers.htm#concealment) in order to attempt a Hide check. [Total cover](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatModifiers.htm#totalCover) or [total concealment](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatModifiers.htm#totalConcealment) usually (but not always; see Special, below) obviates the need for a Hide check, since nothing can see you anyway.\n\nIf people are observing you, even casually, you can’t hide. You can run around a corner or behind cover so that you’re out of sight and then hide, but the others then know at least where you went.\n\nIf your observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a [Bluff](/skills/bluff) check; see below), though, you can attempt to hide. While the others turn their attention from you, you can attempt a Hide check if you can get to a hiding place of some kind. (As a general guideline, the hiding place has to be within 1 foot per rank you have in Hide.) This check, however, is made at a -10 penalty because you have to move fast.\n\n###### Sniping\n\nIf you’ve already successfully hidden at least 10 feet from your target, you can make one ranged attack, then immediately hide again. You take a -20 penalty on your Hide check to conceal yourself after the shot.\n\n###### Creating a Diversion to Hide\n\nYou can use [Bluff](/skills/bluff) to help you hide. A successful [Bluff](/skills/bluff) check can give you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check while people are aware of you.\n\nSee also: [epic usages](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/epic/skills.htm#hide) of Hide.\n\n##### Action\n\nUsually none. Normally, you make a Hide check as part of movement, so it doesn’t take a separate action. However, hiding immediately after a ranged attack (see Sniping, above) is a [move action](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#moveActions).\n\n##### Special\n\nIf you are [invisible](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#invisible), you gain a +40 bonus on Hide checks if you are immobile, or a +20 bonus on Hide checks if you’re moving.\n\nIf you have the [Stealthy](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#stealthy) feat, you get a +2 bonus on Hide checks.\n\nA 13th-level [ranger](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/classes/ranger.htm) can attempt a Hide check in any sort of natural terrain, even if it doesn’t grant [cover](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatModifiers.htm#cover) or [concealment](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatModifiers.htm#concealment). A 17th-level ranger can do this even while being observed."},{"key":"intimidate","url":"http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/intimidate.htm","name":"Intimidate","key_ability":"Cha","desc":"##### Check\n\nYou can change another’s behavior with a successful check. Your Intimidate check is opposed by the target’s modified level check (1d20 + character level or Hit Dice + target’s Wisdom bonus [if any] + target’s modifiers on saves against [fear](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#fear)). If you beat your target’s check result, you may treat the target as friendly, but only for the purpose of actions taken while it remains intimidated. (That is, the target retains its normal attitude, but will chat, advise, offer limited help, or advocate on your behalf while intimidated. See the [Diplomacy](/skills/diplomacy) skill, above, for additional details.) The effect lasts as long as the target remains in your presence, and for 1d6×10 minutes afterward. After this time, the target’s default attitude toward you shifts to unfriendly (or, if normally unfriendly, to hostile).\n\nIf you fail the check by 5 or more, the target provides you with incorrect or useless information, or otherwise frustrates your efforts.\n\n###### Demoralize Opponent\n\nYou can also use Intimidate to weaken an opponent’s resolve in combat. To do so, make an Intimidate check opposed by the target’s modified level check (see above). If you win, the target becomes [shaken](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#shaken) for 1 round. A shaken character takes a -2 penalty on [attack rolls](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#attackRoll), [ability checks](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#abilityChecks), and [saving throws](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#savingThrows). You can intimidate only an opponent that you threaten in melee combat and that can see you.\n\n##### Action\n\nVaries. Changing another’s behavior requires 1 minute of interaction. Intimidating an opponent in combat is a [standard action](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#standardActions).\n\n##### Try Again\n\nOptional, but not recommended because retries usually do not work. Even if the initial check succeeds, the other character can be intimidated only so far, and a retry doesn’t help. If the initial check fails, the other character has probably become more firmly resolved to resist the intimidator, and a retry is futile.\n\n##### Special\n\nYou gain a +4 bonus on your Intimidate check for every size category that you are larger than your target. Conversely, you take a -4 penalty on your Intimidate check for every size category that you are smaller than your target.\n\nA character immune to [fear](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/specialAbilities.htm#fear) can’t be intimidated, nor can nonintelligent creatures.\n\nIf you have the [Persuasive](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#persuasive) feat, you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks.\n\n##### [Synergy](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#skillSynergy)\n\nIf you have 5 or more ranks in [Bluff](/skills/bluff), you get a +2 bonus on Intimidate checks."},{"key":"jump","url":"http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/jump.htm","name":"Jump","key_ability":"Str","armor_check_penalty":true,"desc":"##### Check\n\nThe DC and the distance you can cover vary according to the type of jump you are attempting (see below).\n\nYour Jump check is modified by your speed. If your speed is 30 feet then no modifier based on speed applies to the check. If your speed is less than 30 feet, you take a -6 penalty for every 10 feet of speed less than 30 feet. If your speed is greater than 30 feet, you gain a +4 bonus for every 10 feet beyond 30 feet.\n\nAll Jump DCs given here assume that you get a running start, which requires that you move at least 20 feet in a straight line before attempting the jump. If you do not get a running start, the DC for the jump is doubled.\n\nDistance moved by jumping is counted against your normal maximum movement in a round.\n\nIf you have ranks in Jump and you succeed on a Jump check, you land on your feet (when appropriate). If you attempt a Jump check untrained, you land [prone](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/conditionSummary.htm#prone) unless you beat the DC by 5 or more.\n\nLong Jump DCs | Long Jump Distance | Jump DC1 |\n| --- | --- |\n|  \n1.

At the midpoint of the jump, you attain a vertical height equal to one-quarter of the horizontal distance. The DC for the jump is equal to the distance jumped (in feet).\n\nIf your check succeeds, you land on your feet at the far end. If you fail the check by less than 5, you don’t clear the distance, but you can make a DC 15 [Reflex save](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/combatStatistics.htm#reflex) to grab the far edge of the gap. You end your movement grasping the far edge. If that leaves you dangling over a chasm or gap, getting up requires a [move action](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#moveActions) and a DC 15 [Climb](/skills/climb) check.\n\nHigh Jump DCs | High Jump Distance1 | Jump DC2 |\n| --- | --- |\n|  \n1.

The DC is equal to 4 times the distance to be cleared.\n\nIf you jumped up to grab something, a successful check indicates that you reached the desired height. If you wish to pull yourself up, you can do so with a [move action](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#moveActions) and a DC 15 [Climb](/skills/climb) check. If you fail the Jump check, you do not reach the height, and you land on your feet in the same spot from which you jumped. As with a long jump, the DC is doubled if you do not get a running start of at least 20 feet.\n\nVertical Reach | Creature Size | Vertical Reach |\n| --- | --- |\n| Colossal | 128 ft. |\n| Gargantuan | 64 ft. |\n| Huge | 32 ft. |\n| Large | 16 ft. |\n| Medium | 8 ft. |\n| Small | 4 ft. |\n| Tiny | 2 ft. |\n| Diminutive | 1 ft. |\n| Fine | ½ ft. |\n\nObviously, the difficulty of reaching a given height varies according to the size of the character or creature. The maximum vertical reach (height the creature can reach without jumping) for an average creature of a given size is shown on the table below. (As a Medium creature, a typical human can reach 8 feet without jumping.)\n\nQuadrupedal creatures don’t have the same vertical reach as a bipedal creature; treat them as being one size category smaller.\n\n###### Hop Up\n\nYou can jump up onto an object as tall as your waist, such as a table or small boulder, with a DC 10 Jump check. Doing so counts as 10 feet of movement, so if your speed is 30 feet, you could move 20 feet, then hop up onto a counter. You do not need to get a running start to hop up, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.\n\n###### Jumping Down\n\nIf you intentionally jump from a height, you take less damage than you would if you just fell. The DC to jump down from a height is 15. You do not have to get a running start to jump down, so the DC is not doubled if you do not get a running start.\n\nIf you succeed on the check, you take falling damage as if you had dropped 10 fewer feet than you actually did.\n\n##### Action\n\nNone.

An audience, once it has judged a tumbler as an uninteresting performer, is not receptive to repeat performances.\n\nYou can try to reduce damage from a fall as an instant reaction only once per fall.\n\n##### Special\n\nIf you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you gain a +3 [dodge bonus](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/theBasics.htm#dodgeBonus) to AC when [fighting defensively](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#fightingDefensivelyasaStandardAction) instead of the usual +2 dodge bonus to AC.\n\nIf you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you gain a +6 [dodge bonus](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/theBasics.htm#dodgeBonus) to AC when executing the [total defense](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#totalDefense) [standard action](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#standardActions) instead of the usual +4 dodge bonus to AC.\n\nIf you have the [Acrobatic](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#acrobatic) feat, you get a +2 bonus on Tumble checks.\n\n##### [Synergy](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#skillSynergy)\n\n- If you have 5 or more ranks in Tumble, you get a +2 bonus on [Balance](/skills/balance) and [Jump](/skills/jump) checks.\n- If you have 5 or more ranks in [Jump](/skills/jump), you get a +2 bonus on Tumble checks."},{"key":"useMagicDevice","url":"http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/useMagicDevice.htm","name":"Use Magic Device","key_ability":"Cha","trained_only":true,"desc":"Use this skill to activate magic\n\n##### Check\n\nYou can use this skill to read a spell or to activate a magic item. Use Magic Device lets you use a magic item as if you had the spell ability or class features of another class, as if you were a different race, or as if you were of a different [alignment](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/description.htm#alignment).\n\nYou make a Use Magic Device check each time you activate a device such as a wand. If you are using the check to emulate an [alignment](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/description.htm#alignment) or some other quality in an ongoing manner, you need to make the relevant Use Magic Device check once per hour.\n\nYou must consciously choose which requirement to emulate. That is, you must know what you are trying to emulate when you make a Use Magic Device check for that purpose. The DCs for various tasks involving Use Magic Device checks are summarized on the table below.\n\nUse Magic Device DCs | Task | Use Magic Device DC |\n| --- | --- |\n| Activate blindly | 25 |\n| Decipher a written spell | 25 + spell level |\n| Use a scroll | 20 + caster level |\n| Use a wand | 20 |\n| Emulate a class feature | 20 |\n| Emulate an ability score | See text |\n| Emulate a race | 25 |\n| Emulate an alignment | 30 |\n\n###### Activate Blindly\n\nSome magic items are activated by special words, thoughts, or actions. You can activate such an item as if you were using the activation word, thought, or action, even when you’re not and even if you don’t know it. You do have to perform some equivalent activity in order to make the check. That is, you must speak, wave the item around, or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a special +2 bonus on your Use Magic Device check if you’ve activated the item in question at least once before. If you fail by 9 or less, you can’t activate the device. If you fail by 10 or more, you suffer a mishap. A mishap means that magical energy gets released but it doesn’t do what you wanted it to do. The default mishaps are that the item affects the wrong target or that uncontrolled magical energy is released, dealing 2d6 points of damage to you. This mishap is in addition to the chance for a mishap that you normally run when you cast a spell from a scroll that you could not otherwise cast yourself.\n\n###### Decipher a Written Spell\n\nThis usage works just like deciphering a written spell with the [Spellcraft](/skills/spellcraft) skill, except that the DC is 5 points higher. Deciphering a written spell requires 1 minute of concentration.\n\n###### Emulate an Ability Score\n\nTo cast a spell from a scroll, you need a high score in the appropriate ability (Intelligence for wizard spells, Wisdom for divine spells, or Charisma for sorcerer or bard spells). Your effective ability score (appropriate to the class you’re emulating when you try to cast the spell from the scroll) is your Use Magic Device check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough score in the appropriate ability, you don’t need to make this check.\n\n###### Emulate an Alignment\n\nSome magic items have positive or negative effects based on the user’s [alignment](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/description.htm#alignment). Use Magic Device lets you use these items as if you were of an alignment of your choice. You can emulate only one alignment at a time.\n\n###### Emulate a Class Feature\n\nSometimes you need to use a class feature to activate a magic item. In this case, your effective level in the emulated class equals your Use Magic Device check result minus 20. This skill does not let you actually use the class feature of another class. It just lets you activate items as if you had that class feature. If the class whose feature you are emulating has an [alignment](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/description.htm#alignment) requirement, you must meet it, either honestly or by emulating an appropriate alignment with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).\n\n###### Emulate a Race\n\nSome magic items work only for members of certain races, or work better for members of those races. You can use such an item as if you were a race of your choice. You can emulate only one race at a time.\n\n###### Use a Scroll\n\nIf you are casting a spell from a scroll, you have to decipher it first. Normally, to cast a spell from a scroll, you must have the scroll’s spell on your class spell list. Use Magic Device allows you to use a scroll as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster level of the spell you are trying to cast from the scroll. In addition, casting a spell from a scroll requires a minimum score (10 + spell level) in the appropriate ability. If you don’t have a sufficient score in that ability, you must emulate the ability score with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).\n\nThis use of the skill also applies to other [spell completion](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/magicItemBasics.htm#spellCompletion) magic items.\n\n###### Use a Wand\n\nNormally, to use a wand, you must have the wand’s spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill allows you to use a wand as if you had a particular spell on your class spell list. This use of the skill also applies to other [spell trigger](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/magicItems/magicItemBasics.htm#spellTrigger) magic items, such as staffs.\n\n##### Action\n\nNone. The Use Magic Device check is made as part of the action (if any) required to activate the magic item.\n\n##### Try Again\n\nYes, but if you ever roll a natural 1 while attempting to activate an item and you fail, then you can’t try to activate that item again for 24 hours.\n\n##### Special\n\nYou cannot [take 10](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#taking10) with this skill.\n\nYou can’t [aid another](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#aidAnother) on Use Magic Device checks. Only the user of the item may attempt such a check.\n\nIf you have the [Magical Aptitude](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#magicalAptitude) feat, you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks.\n\n##### [Synergy](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#skillSynergy)\n\n- If you have 5 or more ranks in [Spellcraft](/skills/spellcraft), you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks related to scrolls.\n- If you have 5 or more ranks in [Decipher Script](/skills/decipherScript), you get a +2 bonus on Use Magic Device checks related to scrolls.\n- If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Magic Device, you get a +2 bonus to [Spellcraft](/skills/spellcraft) checks made to decipher spells on scrolls."},{"key":"useRope","url":"http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/useRope.htm","name":"Use Rope","key_ability":"Dex","desc":"##### Check\n\nMost tasks with a rope are relatively simple. The DCs for various tasks utilizing this skill are summarized on the table below.\n\nUse Rope DCs | Use Rope DC | Task |\n| --- | --- |\n|  \n1. Add 2 to the DC for every 10 feet the hook is thrown; see below.\n\n|\n| 10 | Tie a firm knot |\n| 101 | Secure a grappling hook |\n| 15 | Tie a special knot, such as one that slips,  \nslides slowly, or loosens with a tug |\n| 15 | Tie a rope around yourself one-handed |\n| 15 | Splice two ropes together |\n| Varies | Bind a character |\n\n###### Secure a Grappling Hook\n\nSecuring a grappling hook requires a Use Rope check (DC 10, +2 for every 10 feet of distance the grappling hook is thrown, to a maximum DC of 20 at 50 feet). Failure by 4 or less indicates that the hook fails to catch and falls, allowing you to try again. Failure by 5 or more indicates that the grappling hook initially holds, but comes loose after 1d4 rounds of supporting weight. This check is made secretly, so that you don’t know whether the rope will hold your weight.\n\n###### Bind a Character\n\nWhen you bind another character with a rope, any [Escape Artist](/skills/escapeArtist) check that the bound character makes is opposed by your Use Rope check.\n\nYou get a +10 bonus on this check because it is easier to bind someone than to escape from bonds. You don’t even make your Use Rope check until someone tries to escape.\n\nSee also: [epic usages](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/epic/skills.htm#useRope) of Use Rope.\n\n##### Action\n\nVaries. Throwing a grappling hook is a [standard action](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#standardActions) that provokes an [attack of opportunity](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/attacksOfOpportunity.htm). Tying a knot, tying a special knot, or tying a rope around yourself one-handed is a [full-round action](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/combat/actionsInCombat.htm#fullRoundActions) that provokes an attack of opportunity. Splicing two ropes together takes 5 minutes. Binding a character takes 1 minute.\n\n##### Special\n\nA silk rope gives you a +2 [circumstance bonus](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/theBasics.htm#circumstanceModifier) on Use Rope checks. If you cast an [animate rope](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/spells/animateRope.htm) spell on a rope, you get a +2 circumstance bonus on any Use Rope checks you make when using that rope.\n\nThese bonuses stack.\n\nIf you have the [Deft Hands](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/feats.htm#deftHands) feat, you get a +2 bonus on Use Rope checks.\n\n##### [Synergy](http://www.d20srd.org/srd/skills/usingSkills.htm#skillSynergy)\n\n- If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on [Climb](/skills/climb) checks made to climb a rope, a knotted rope, or a rope-and-wall combination.\n- If you have 5 or more ranks in Use Rope, you get a +2 bonus on [Escape Artist](/skills/escapeArtist) checks when escaping from rope bonds.\n- If you have 5 or more ranks in [Escape Artist](/skills/escapeArtist), you get a +2 bonus on checks made to bind someone."}]
