## DnD City
### High Level Project Description

Our project is called DnD City. 

DnD City is a Character Sheet tracking system for table top role playing games. 
Specifically [Dungeons and Dragons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) 
[3.5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons#Dungeons_.26_Dragons_v3.5).

We will be using the Open Game Content released from Wizards of the Coast for our reference and game rules: 
* [Official Open Game Content Documentation](http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=d20/article/srd35)
* [Online D20 Game Documentation (SRD)](http://www.d20srd.org/)

Anyone who has ever played DnD knows how frustrating it can be to manage your characters, campaigns, and all the other paperwork needed to even get together and play. DnDCity aims to fix that. The Goal of the project is to make keeping track of the information relating to characters in the game faster and easier.

We will be using a website for our User interface, which will feature multiple pages and forms that users will use to create and manage their characters, items, or campaigns.

The users of the website can be categorized into three distinct roles:

* A Campaign Creator or Owner is the person who initially creates a campaign and invites the group of players to join it.
* The Game Master (or DM as he is sometimes referred to), is the person who directs the game play, and determines the outcomes of players actions. 
* The Players each determine the actions of one or more characters in the game itself. 

Keeping track of the Users, and their character sheets, will provide us with ample opportunity to employ multiple database tables. We will limit the number of tables by being selective in which potential features we implement.

The nature of the web based architecture we will be using inherently has multiple processes and inter-process communication. Web Browsers, Servers, and Database engines will all be communicating together to deliver the application to the users.

In order to keep track of all of the various tasks this project will endeavor, we will be using github.com.
