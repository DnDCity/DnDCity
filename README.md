## DnD City - Website developed using Ruby on Rails

DnD City is a Character Sheet tracking system for table top role playing games. 

Initial development was targeted for [Dungeons and Dragons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons) [3.5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Editions_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons#Dungeons_.26_Dragons_v3.5).

The Goals of the project is to make keeping track of the information relating to characters in the game faster and easier.  Anyone who has ever played DnD knows how frustrating it can get to manage your characters, campaigns, and all the other paperwork necessary to get together and play. DnDCity aims to fix that. 

The users of the website can be divided into three distinct categories: the Campaign Creator, the Game Master (or DM as he is sometimes referred to), and the Player. The Campaign Creator is the person who initially organizes the group of players to form campaign parties. The Game Master is the person who directs the game play, and determines the outcomes of players actions. Finally, the Player is the person who determines the actions of one or more characters in the game itself. 

Keeping track of the Users, and their character sheets will provide us with ample opportunity to employ multiple database tables. We will limit the number of tables by being selective in which potential features we implement.
